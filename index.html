I study business and administration and since a young age fascinated by economic mechanism and their interdependence.

				<h2><strong>Fashion</strong></h2>
					<p>My hobbies include fashion as it is a form of activity where I can express myself starting with the way I dress to observing the trends and their ongoing changes. Additionally, it is a form of self-care as taking the time to dress well and feel good about one's appearance can be a form of self-care that boosts confidence and mood. It can also be a way to relax and de-stress by focusing on something enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

				<h2><strong>Tennis</strong></h2>
					
						<p>Secondly, I love the game of tennis. Tennis is a sport that can be played either by yourself or with other people, making it a versatile and exciting time. Tennis may be an excellent way to exercise and have fun, whether you play a game with a buddy or smash against a wall.</p>

				<h2><strong>Yoga</strong></h2>
					<p>Lastly, yoga is a leisure that entails a variety of postures and motions that may help to improve flexibility, strength, balance, and cardiovascular health. But, a reason why I like it so much is that it is a type of relaxation and stress reduction. The exercise involves mindfulness, meditation, and breathing exercises that can help lower anxiety.</p>
